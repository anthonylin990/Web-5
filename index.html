			<h2>Winner Stays On (Nike)</h2>
			<p>
				This ad was originally released during the leadup of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It appeals to the fantasy of emulating our idols, 
				almost every kid would say "I'm X" or yell "Kobe!" to sink a basket.

			<h2>Golden Epic Trailer - Amphoreus Saga of Heroes (Honkai: Star Rail)</h2>
			<p>
				Annoucing the upcoming region and next chapter for their game <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em>, Hoyoverse makes use of incredible visual storytelling, combining a more modern anime style with elements of ancient Greek and Roman art. <br>
				Someone who's never played the game could tell that this region will be heavily influenced by ancient Greece and the myth of how the gods overthrew the titans.

			<h2>Boy (Nationwide)</h2>
			<p>
				Originally released during Super Bowl XLIX (2015, Patriots vs. Seahawks) this ad was an absolute gut-punch.  It drives home how easy it is for the unexpected to happen and to be prepared for it.
